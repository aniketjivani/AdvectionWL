Use Clawpack (https://www.clawpack.org) - routines for FV methods for hyperbolic systems - to implement 2D advection in cylindrical coordinates with given initial condition for C3 coronagraph white light images.

Repo contains tutorials from Clawpack and preprocessing scripts for appropriate data conversion of the white light simulation outputs.

Need to basically implement boundary conditions correctly frm this: https://www.clawpack.org/gallery/_static/amrclaw/examples/advection_2d_inflow/_plots/allframes_fig0.html

and this: https://www.clawpack.org/gallery/_static/amrclaw/examples/advection_2d_inflow/README.html

Take help from this: https://www.clawpack.org/gallery/_static/amrclaw/examples/advection_2d_annulus/README.html
