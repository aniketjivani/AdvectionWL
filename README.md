Use Clawpack (https://www.clawpack.org) - routines for FV methods for hyperbolic systems - to implement 2D advection in cylindrical coordinates with given initial condition for C3 coronagraph white light images.

Repo contains tutorials from Clawpack and preprocessing scripts for appropriate data conversion of the white light simulation outputs.
